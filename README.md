This an research assignment under the guidance of Dr. Pavlos Protopapas. 

The main objective of this project is to build the language models and embeddings, which are crucial components in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Main Idea
The central theme of the project revolves around the concept of embeddings. Embeddings are a type of word representation that allows words with similar meaning to have a similar representation. They are a distributed representation for text that is perhaps one of the key breakthroughs for the impressive performance of deep learning methods on challenging natural language processing problems.

Project Execution
Implementing and exploring embeddings using Python libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.

Data Visualization
The project also emphasizes the importance of data visualization.
Including clear labels and descriptive titles for their plots. This not only aids in understanding the results but also in communicating findings effectively.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project serves as a comprehensive introduction to language models and embeddings.
